## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running with Prisma and ensure the `prisma/generated` folder is created properly.

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install all required dependencies for the project.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Generate Prisma Client and Artifacts**: Prisma generates the database client and optionally other files (like types or codegen outputs) into the `prisma/generated` folder. To generate everything:
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    ```
    This command reads your `schema.prisma` file and creates the necessary output in `node_modules/.prisma` and (if configured) in `prisma/generated`. Re-run this command any time you modify your Prisma schema.

3. **Apply Database Migrations**: If you're using Prisma Migrate and have migrations defined, run:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```
    This will:
    - Apply all pending migrations to your local database
    - Generate the Prisma Client
    - Optionally run seed scripts if configured

4. **Open Prisma Studio (Optional)**: Prisma Studio is a visual interface to explore and manipulate your database during development.
    ```bash
    npx prisma studio
    ```
    This opens a browser window where you can browse tables, add records, and debug data visually.

5. **Notes on `prisma/generated`**: If your project is configured to use the `prisma/generated` folder (e.g., for custom types or GraphQL artifacts), it will be populated by `npx prisma generate`. This folder is typically **auto-generated** and should either be:
    - Ignored in version control (`.gitignore`), or
    - Re-generated by every contributor using the steps above.

    Do **not** manually edit files in `prisma/generated` unless explicitly intended.
